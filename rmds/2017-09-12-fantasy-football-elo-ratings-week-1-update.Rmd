```

## Dashboard

Through `r params$weeks_played` week, `r leader` is our most likely regular season champion, with a `r leader_p_win*100`% chance of taking home the title.

```{r echo = FALSE}
sim_dashboard %>% 
  select(-current_season, -weeks_played) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Owner", "Rating", "1 Week Change", "YTD Wins", "Sim Wins", "P(1st)"),
        align = c("c", "c", "c", "c", "c", "c"))
```

## Predicted Win Totals

The graphic below shows the distribution of possible win totals for each owner generated by simulating the remaining `r 13-params$weeks_played` weeks of the season `r params$n_sims` times.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 8}

```

## Predictions for Week `r params$weeks_played + 1`
```{r echo = FALSE}
<<next_week_matchups>>
kable(next_week_matchups, col.names = c("Matchup", "Probability"), align = c('l', 'c'))
```
